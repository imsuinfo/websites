==================
7.x-1.0-unstable5
==================
- install instructions:  disable and uninstall previous ldap modules. make sure tables are removed.
------------------
- main focus of unstable 5 is ldap_authentication including  finishing out features, improving usability,
fixing bugs, documentation and setting up tests. ldap_authorization still needs features to be
finished out, documentation and usability improvements, and a set of tests.
- ldap_authentication: reordered authentication validation related to issue #1022362
- ldap_authentication: added test grid for ldap_authentication testing:  http://drupal.org/node/1053818
- ldap_authentication: added typical authentication configurations: http://drupal.org/node/1053748
- ldap_help:  added "status" and "issue reporting" tabs to improve testing and bug reporting
- ldap_authentication: removed option to allow ldap users to change, have separate drupal email.  this feature needs more work if desired at all.
- ldap_authentication: added configurable help link for ldap password resetting.
- ldap_authentication: made more content themeable, especially where localized ldap user help may be a factor
- ldap_authentication: #807416  finished and tested white lists 
- ldap_authentication: clarified and tested rules for existing drupal account conflicts.  Desired behavior is in 
tests (ldap_authentication.tests.txt).
- ldap_authentication: #968574, #256226, #258974 added "Account Creation for LDAP Authenticated Users" section for account creation.  Desired behavior is in 
tests (ldap_authentication.tests.txt).  Pushed some configuration over to user settings page.
- ldap_servers: #1050590 added check for existance of https in $_SERVER array per 
- ldap_authorization: #1050944 fixed array work ldap to role mapping. 
- ldap_servers: improved wording on required https message and made themeable 
- ldap_authentication: #1023510 several tweaks for ldap authentication settings related to location and visibility of password, 
password reset links, account creation links, etc. Many of the combinations made no sense and the form was overly complex.  The logic is
articulated in the ldap authentication settings form and ldap_authentication.tests.txt
- ldap_authentication: moved request account and password reset link hide/show logic from theming layer to menu/permission layer.
makes more sense and reduced code alot.
- another trip through drupal code module
