INTRODUCTION
------------
Adds node-type specific permissions that allow users who do not own a
particular node to view that node if it is unpublished. This is useful for
case where users use workflows. This module should integrate with most
drupal modules without modification. This can still be used in conjunction
with a dedicated workflow system.
